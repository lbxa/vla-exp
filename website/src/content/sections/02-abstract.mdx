## Abstract

**Copy your abstract from Notion here.** 

This section should contain your complete abstract, which typically includes:

- **Problem Statement:** What challenge are you addressing?
- **Approach:** What method or technique did you develop?
- **Key Results:** What are the main findings?
- **Impact:** Why does this matter?

For reference, you can check out similar work in [deep learning research](https://arxiv.org) or explore [open source implementations](https://github.com). Many researchers also share their datasets on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) for reproducible research.

Replace this placeholder text with your actual abstract from your Notion document.
